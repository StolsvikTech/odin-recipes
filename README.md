## Learning Opportunity
* Learn the basics of HTML, such as the primary html, head, body and meta tags that
make up the base structure of the site.

* Next I use tags like h-tags for headers, p-tags for paragraphs, ol- and ul-tags to
define ordered and unordered lists respectively, both with li-tags inside.

* I also use a-tags for links, img-tags for images and "sprinkle" in some br-tags and strong-/em-tags to make it more structured and to provide more emphasis or signal
that I have information that should be given more "oomf" in it's presentation and
reading.

* I also include attributes to define characteristics and behaviors, such as lang to define what language i.e a screen reader should expect, alt attribute for images, so that a screen reader can read out what the image is, and more.
